# Raku Console UI Toolkit Vikna

Pronounced as _Veekna_. In Ukrainian means 'windows'. ;)

**IMPORTANT!** This project requires Raku to implement chained dispatching. Because my implementation of the feature for 
Rakudo had to be reverted from the master Vikna won't work with standard Rakudo releases. But it can be tried with 
`v-dispatchers` branch in either [main Rakudo repository](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/tree/v-dispatchers) or in
[my fork of it](https://github.com/vrurg/rakudo/tree/v-dispatchers). The situation will change when Jonathan Worthington
will succeed with his total redesign of dispatching which is much awaited by many as it gonna bring a lot of new
opportunities to Rakudo.
