# Raku Console UI Toolkit Vikna

Pronounced as _Veekna_. In Ukrainian it means 'windows'. ;)

# **IMPORTANT!** 

Vikna is in its deep, deep infancy stage. Mostly being a proof of concept now than a real thing. Yet, it already has
many of the key elements an UI framework must have. Just check out 
[_./examples_](https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/tree/v0.0.1/examples) directory to get the first impression. But be
patient when trying [_threaded-rainbow.raku_](https://github.com/vrurg/raku-Vikna/blob/master/examples/threaded-rainbow.raku).

The project requires Raku to implement chained dispatching. Because my implementation of the feature for 
Rakudo had to be reverted from the _master_ Vikna won't work correctly with standard Rakudo releases. But it can be tried with 
_v-dispatchers_ branch in either [main Rakudo repository](https://github.com/rakudo/rakudo/tree/v-dispatchers) or in
[my fork of it](https://github.com/vrurg/rakudo/tree/v-dispatchers). The situation will change when Jonathan Worthington
will succeed with his total redesign of dispatching which is much awaited by many as it gonna bring a lot of new
opportunities to Rakudo.
